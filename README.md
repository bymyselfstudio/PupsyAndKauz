# Pupsy & Kauz - Chase Of The Heart Key

This project is a game, based on several mini games and a story behind.
First it's just one of my learning spaces to understand programming and
the proper usage of Unity 3D. 
The idea came up with the problem, that I didn't know how to combine all 
the tutorial stuff I learned over time via many tutorials.
In most cases, tutors solve little problems, but creating a playable game will
consider many techniques and programming structures who all should work together in
the most performant way that is possible.
So while I did my weekly kayak runs I wondered, if I would be able to simulate
riding a kayak in Unity and that was the kick-off event for this first game.
The future result will be a compilation of several mini games, depending on different 
game mechanics.
Another part of the game creation consists of designing and modeling the assets
with Blender, because I don't like to re-use other people's assets. 
The issue is that I'm a total beginner with Blender and need to learn 3D skills as well.
