# Pupsy & Kauz - Chase Of The Heart Key

This project is a game, based on several mini games and a story behind.
First it's just one of my learning spaces to understand programming and
the proper usage of Unity 3D. 
The idea came up with the problem, that I didn't know
how to combine all the tutorial stuff I learned over time via many tutorials.
In most cases, tutors solve little problems with one special technique, but 
they never explain, how to interact between classes or I didn't understand
the explanations. 
So while I did my weekly kayak runs I wondered, if I would be able to simulate
riding a kayak in Unity and that was the kick-off event for that game.

Another part of the game creation consists of designing and modeling the meshes
with Blender, because I don't like to re-use other people's meshes.
